Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; each came with his household,"Ndele omadina ovana ovamati vaIsrael ava ve uya kuEgipiti oo aa; ovo ve uya pamwe naJakob, keshe umwe neumbo laye"
"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 3Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 4Dan and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher","Ruben, Simeon, Levi naJuda, 3Isaskar, Sebulon naBenjamin, 4Dan naNaftali, Gad naAsser"
All the descendants of Jacob were seventy people; Joseph was [already] in Egypt.,Neemwenyo adishe edi da dja momatundji aJakob odo oda li eemwenyo omilongo heyali. Ndelenee Josef okwa li muEgipiti
"Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation, 7but the Israelites were prolific and increased greatly","Ndele Josef okwa fya, novamwaxe vaye aveshe, nepupi alishe linya. 7Ndelenee Ovaisraeli va li ve noludalo ndele va ninga vahapu,"
"they multiplied and became extremely strong, so that the land was filled with them.",ndele va hapupala ndele va ninga vahapu neenghono nova yadifa oshilongo.
"Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph [nor the history of his accomplishments].","Opo nee ohamba ipe ya holoka tai pangele Egipiti, yo ya li inai shiiva Josef nande."
"He said to his people, “Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are too many and too mighty for us [they greatly outnumber us].","Yo oya lombwela ovanhu vayo: “Taleni, oshiwana shOvaisraeli osha ninga shinene shi neenghono shi tu dule."
"Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, so that they will not multiply and in the event of war, join our enemies, and fight against us and escape from the land.” ","Hano ileni, fye tu pangeleni omhangela momakoto oku va kondjifa, vo vaha dule okuhapupala, nongeenge hatu hangika koita, vo vaha ame kovatondadi vetu noku tu lwifa, ndele tava di mo moshilongo.”"
So they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with hard labor. And the sons of Israel built Pithom and Raamses as storage cities for Pharaoh. ,Opo nee vo ova pewa ovapashukili oku va hepeka noilonga idjuu. Ndele vo ova tungila Farao oituvikilwalando Pitom naRamses.
"But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more they multiplied and expanded, so that the Egyptians dreaded and were exasperated by the Israelites. ","Ndelenee okuhepekwa kwavo eshi kwa hapupala, nokuhapupala kwavo kwa ehena komesho, nova tandavela; opo Ovaegipiti va tila Ovaisraeli. "
And the Egyptians made the Israelites serve rigorously [forcing them into severe slavery].,"Onghee hano Ovaegipiti va fininika Ovaisraeli noilonga idjuu youpika,"
"They made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar, brick, and all kinds of field work. All their labor was harsh and severe.","nokukalamwenyo kwavo kwa lulumikwa noilonga idjuu yomunoko needopi noilonga i lili nai lili momapya, heeno, noilonga i lili nai lili ve i fininikilwa ve i longe."
"Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah (beauty) and the other named Puah (splendor), ","Nohamba yaEgipiti ya lombwela ovadalifi Ovaheberi, umwe, edina laye Sifra nolamukwao Pua,"
"“When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, she shall live.” ","ndele tai ti: “Nye eshi tamu kwafa ovalikadi Ovaheberi mokudala omu nokutala pokudalifa, ngeenge okamati, mu noku ka dipaa, ndelenee ngeenge okakadona, naka kale nomwenyo.” "
"But the midwives feared God [with profound reverence] and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded, but they let the boy babies live.","Ndelenee ovadalifi ava va li ovatilikalunga noinava ninga ngaashi ohamba yaEgipiti ye va lombwela, ndelenee va efa ouhanana oumati va kale ve nomwenyo."
"So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this thing, and allowed the boy babies to live?” ",Opo nee ohamba yaEgipiti ya ifana ovadalifi ndele tai ti kuvo: “Omolwashike mwe shi ninga nomwa efa ouhanana oumati va kale nomwenyo?”
"The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth quickly and their babies are born before the midwife can get to them.” ","Novadalifi va lombwela Farao, tava ti: “Ovalikadi Ovaheberi hasho ve li ngaashi Ovaegipiti, osheshi venya ve neenghono, fimbo omudalifi ina fika kuvo, ova dala nokuli.”"
"So God was good to the midwives, and the people [of Israel] multiplied and became very strong. ",Ndelenee Kalunga okwa nangeka noupuna ovadalifi. Noshiwana osha hapupala nosha ninga shinene shi neenghono. 
"And because the midwives feared God [with profound reverence], He established families and households for them.","Ndele ovadalifi eshi va tila Kalunga, Ye okwe va pa oludalo lihapu."
"Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “Every son who is born [to the Hebrews] must be thrown into the Nile, but every daughter you shall keep alive.","Opo nee Farao okwa lombwela ovanhu vaye aveshe, ndele ta ti: “Ovana aveshe ovamati ava tava dalwa ve nokweekelwa muNil, ndelenee oukadona aveshe nava efuwe ve nomwenyo.”"
Now a man of the house of Levi [the priestly tribe] went and took as his wife a daughter of Levi. ,Nomulumenhu umwe womepata laLevi okwa ya nokwa hombola omona waLevi
"The woman conceived and gave birth to a son; and when she saw that he was [especially] beautiful and healthy, she hid him for three months [to protect him from the Egyptians].","Nomwalikadi a ninga oufimba nokwa dala okaana okamati. Ndele ye eshi a mona nokutya, ko okawa, ye e ka holeka eehani nhatu."
"When she could no longer hide him, she got him a basket (chest) made of papyrus reeds and covered it with tar and pitch [making it waterproof]. Then she put the child in it and set it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile. ","Ndelenee ye eshi ina dula vali oku ka holeka, okwe ka kufila okakefa komanenge nokwe ka hotifa eka, nokwa nangeka mo okaana ndele te ka tula momanenge pomunghulo waNil."
And his sister [Miriam] stood some distance away to find out what would happen to him.,"Nomumwaina wako okakadona okwa li kwinya konima kanini, e ka mone nhumbi taka ningwa."
"Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the Nile, and [she, together with] her maidens walked along the river’s bank; she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid [to get it], and she brought it to her.","Ndele okakadona omona waFarao okwa ya kuNil e ke likoshe mo, fimbo ovapiya vaye ovakainhu va endaenda komunghulo waNil. Ndele ye eshi a mona ko okakefa momanenge, okwa tuma ko omupiya waye nokwe ka kufa ko."
"When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. And she took pity on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”","Ye eshi e ka tuula, okwa mona okaana, ndele tala, ko oka li okaana okamati taka lili. Ndele ye okwe ka fila onghenda ndele ta ti: “Aka okamwe kounona oumati vOvaheberi.”"
"Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call a wet-nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?” ","Opo nee omumwaina wako okakadona ka tya komona okakadona kaFarao: “Owa hala ndi ku kongele omunyamifi movalikadi Ovaheberi, ye a nyamife okaana?”"
"And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go ahead.” So the girl went and called the child’s mother.",Ndele okakadona omona waFarao okwe mu nyamukula ta ti: “Heeno”. Okakadona oka tondoka noka ifana ina yokaana. 
"Then Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him.",Opo nee okakadona omona waFarao e mu lombwela ta ti: “Tambula okaana aka okamati u ka nyamifile nge nohandi ke ku futa. Nomwalikadi okwa tambula okamati nokwe ka nyamifa.” 
"And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. And she named him Moses, and said, “Because I drew him out of the water.”","Ndelenee okaana eshi ka kula, okwe ka twala kokakadona omona waFarao. Nokwa ninga omona waye omumati. Ndele ye okwe mu luka Moses ndele ta ti: “Ame onde mu kufa momeva.”"
"One day, after Moses had grown [into adulthood], it happened that he went to his countrymen and looked [with compassion] at their hard labors; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his countrymen. ","Ndele opa ningwa pomafiku enya Moses eshi a kula, okwa ya a ka talele po ovakwao, ovamwaxe nokwa mona oshilonga shavo shidjuu. Nokwa mona omulumenhu Omuegipiti nhumbi a denga omulumenhu Omuheberi, umwe womovakwao."
"He turned to look around, and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.","Ndele ye okwa lengalenga kombinga nombinga ndele eshi a mona pehe na ovanhu, ye okwa dipaa Omuegipiti ndele te mu fudike medu."
"He went out the next day and saw two Hebrew men fighting with each other; and he said to the aggressor, “Why are you striking your friend?” ","Mefiku lomongula ye okwa ya ko vali, ndele pa li ovalumenhu vavali Ovaheberi va dengafana. Opo nee ye a pula kwaau e noushima: “Oshike to dengele omukweni?”"
"But the man said, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and said, “Certainly this incident is known.”","Ndele ye okwa nyamukula ta ti: “Olyelye e ku tula po u kale omwene nomutokoli wetu? Wa hala ngeno okudipaa nge, ngaashi wa dipaa Omuegipiti?” Ndele Moses okwa tila ndele ta ti: “Oshili, oshinima sha shiivika.”"
"When Pharaoh heard about this matter, he tried to kill Moses. Then Moses fled from Pharaoh’s presence and took refuge in the land of Midian, where he sat down by a well.","Ndele Farao eshi e di kundana, ye a konga Moses e mu dipae. Ndelenee Moses okwa yaFarao onhapo nokwa tula medu laMidian, ndele a kala omutumba pomufima umwe."
Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water [from the well where Moses was resting] and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. ,Ndele omupristeli waMidian okwa li e novana oukadona vaheyali. Vo ove uya komufima okuteka omeva nokuxwiila oimuna yaxe.
"Then shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock. ","Ndelenee ovafita ve uya nove va taataa mo. Opo nee Moses okwa fikama nokwe va kwafa, ndele ta xwiile oimuna yavo. "
"When they came to Reuel (Jethro) their father, he said, “How is it that you have come back so soon today?”",Ndele eshi ve uya kuxe yavo Rehuel ye okwa tya: “Ongahelipi mwa endelela nena?”
"They said, “An Egyptian saved us from the shepherds. He even drew water [from the well] for us and watered the flock.”",Ndele vo tava nyamukula: “Omulumenhu Omuegipiti okwe tu popila kovafita. Nokwe tu tekela omeva ndele a xwiila oimuna.”
"Then he said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why have you left the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat.”",Opo ye ta ti kovana vaye oukadona: “Ye oku li peni? Omolwashike mwe mu fiila ko? Mu ifaneni ye e uye okulya omungome.”
"Moses was willing to remain with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah [to be his wife]","Ndele Moses okwa hokwa po nokwa kala pomulumenhu ou, ndele ye okwe mu pa omona okakadona Sippora. "
"She gave birth to a son, and he named him Gershom (stranger); for he said, “I have been a stranger in a foreign land.”","Ndele ye eshi a dala okaana okamati, Moses okwe ka luka Gersom. Osheshi ye a tile: “Ame nda kala ngaashi omunailongo koilongo.”"
"Now it happened after a long time [about forty years] that the king of Egypt died. And the children of Israel (Jacob) groaned and sighed because of the bondage, and they cried out. And their cry for help because of their bondage ascended to God.","Ndele efimbo lile eshi la pita po, ohamba yaEgipiti oya fya. NOvaisraeli ova kuwa nokulila omolwoupika. Ndele onghuwo yavo molwoupika wavo oya fika kuKalunga."
"So God heard their groaning and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Israel).","Ndele Kalunga okwa uda ekemo lavo, naKalunga okwa dimbulukwa ehangano laye naAbraham naIsak naJakob."
"God saw the sons of Israel, and God took notice [of them] and was concerned about them ","Ndele Kalunga okwa tala Ovaisraeli, nokwe va kalela noshisho."
"Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro (Reuel) his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb (Sinai), the mountain of God.","Ndele Moses okwa lifa oimuna yaxemweno Jetro, omupristeli waMidian. Ndelenee efiku limwe ye eshi a twalele oimuna langhele kwinya kouninginino wombuwa, okwe uya komhunda yaKalunga nokutya Horeb. "
"The Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a blazing flame of fire from the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was on fire, yet it was not consumed. ","Opo nee omweengeli wOmwene okwe mu lihololela momutemo womundilo moshixwa sheno. Ndele ye eshi a tala ko shili, oshixwa sheno osha xwama omundilo, ndelenee inashi lungwina po komundilo! "
"So Moses said, “I must turn away [from the flock] and see this great sight—why the bush is not burned up.”","Ndele Moses ta ti: “Onda hala ndi ehene ko popepi ndi tale emoniko eli linene, omolwashike oshixwa sheno itashi lungwina po.” "
"When the Lord saw that he turned away [from the flock] to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.”","Omwene eshi a mona ta ehene po e shi tale, Kalunga okwe mu ifana, ta popi moshixwa sheno ta ti: “Moses, Moses!” Ndele ye ta nyamukula: “Aame ou!” "
"Then God said, “Do not come near; take your sandals off your feet [out of respect], because the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” ","Ndele Ye ta ti: “Ino ehena oku. Dula ko eenghaku keemhadi doye, osheshi onhele apa u li ofika oyo edu liyapuki.”"
"Then He said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Then Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.","Ye ta ti vali: “Aame Kalunga kooxo, Kalunga kaAbraham, Kalunga kaIsak naKalunga kaJakob.” Opo nee Moses okwa uvika oshipala shaye, osheshi okwa tila okutala Kalunga."
"The Lord said, “I have in fact seen the affliction (suffering, desolation) of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters (oppressors); for I know their pain and suffering.","NOmwene ta ti: “Ame onda mona okuhepekwa kwoshiwana shange, eshi shi li muEgipiti. Naame onda uda onghuwo yavo omolwovafininiki, heeno, ondi wete oudjuu wavo."
"So I have come down to rescue them from the hand (power) of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a land [that is] good and spacious, to a land flowing with milk and honey [a land of plenty]—to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. ","Onghee nde uya poshi, ndi va kulile mo meke lOvaegipiti, nondi va twale medu linya, medu liwa nola mbwalangadja, medu li yadi omashini nomaadi eenyiki, medu omo Ovakaanan nOvaheti nOvaamori nOvaperesi nOvahevi nOvajebusi ve li mo. "
"Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me; and I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them.","Ndele paife tala, onghuwo nekemo lOvaisraeli oya fika kwaame. Nonda mona yo ehepeko nalo Ovaegipiti tave va hepeke. "
"Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and then bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.” ","Hano inda ko, Ame ohandi ku tumu kuFarao, u pitife mo muEgipiti oshiwana shange Ovaisraeli.” "
"But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?”","Ndelenee Moses okwa lombwela Kalunga ta ti: “Aame omushike ndi ye kuFarao, nondi pitife mo Ovaisraeli muEgipiti?” "
"And God said, “Certainly I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve and worship God at this mountain.”","Ndele Ye ta nyamukula: “Ame ohandi ka kala pamwe naave, naashi tashi ningi edidiliko kwoove nokutya, Ame nde ku tuma ko: ove eshi wa pitifa mo oshiwana muEgipiti, vo otava ka longela Kalunga komhunda tuu ei.”"
"Then Moses said to God, “Behold, when I come to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers (ancestors) has sent me to you,’ and they say to me, ‘What is His name?’ What shall I say to them?” ","Opo nee Moses okwa lombwela Kalunga ta ti: “Ndelenee ame ngeenge handi i kOvaisraeli ndele handi va lombwele: ‘Kalunga kooxo okwa tuma nge kunye,’ ndele tava pula nge: ‘Olyelye edina laye?’ Ohandi va nyamukula shike?”"
"God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM”; and He said, “You shall say this to the Israelites, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’ ” ","Ndele Kalunga ta ti kuMoses: “Aame tuu Ame. U nokunyamukula Ovaisraeli u tye ngaha: ‘Aame tuu Ame,’ a tuma nge kunye.” "
"Then God also said to Moses, “This is what you shall say to the Israelites, ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (Israel), has sent me to you.’ This is My Name forever, and this is My memorial [name] to all generations. ","Opo nee Kalunga okwa lombwela vali Moses ta ti: “Odo u noku di shiivifila Ovaisraeli: ‘Omwene Kalunga kooxo, Kalunga kaAbraham naKalunga kaIsak naKalunga kaJakob okwa tuma nge kunye.’ Olo edina lange fiyo alushe nalo Ame handi ifanwa kepupi fiyo okepupi. "
"Go, gather the elders (tribal leaders) of Israel together, and say to them, ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, “I am indeed concerned about you and what has been done to you in Egypt. ","Inda ko u shivile ko ovakulunhu vOvaisraeli noku va lombwela: ‘Omwene, Kalunga kooxo okwe liholola kwaame, Kalunga kaAbraham, kaIsak nokaJakob.’ ” Ndele okwa tya: “Oshili Ame ohandi mu pashukile noku mu kalela noshisho nokutala eshi tashi mu ningilwa muEgipiti. "
"So I said I will bring you up out of the suffering and oppression of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.” ’ ","Onghee hano onda tokola mwaame kutya: ‘Ame onda hala oku mu pitifa mo moudjuu womuEgipiti noku mu twala medu lOvakaanan nolOvaheti nolOvaamori nolOvaperesi nolOvahevi nolOvajebusi, moshilongo shi yadi omashini nomaadi eenyiki.’"
"The elders [of the tribes] will listen and pay attention to what you say; and you, with the elders of Israel, shall go to the king of Egypt and you shall say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us; so now, please, [we ask and plead with you,] let us go on a three days’ journey into the wilderness, so that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.’ ","“Ndele vo otave ke ku uda. Opo nee nye novakulunhu vOvaisraeli mu nokuya kohamba yaEgipiti, nomu noku i lombwela: ‘Omwene Kalunga kOvaheberi okwe tu shakeneka. Hano tu lekela paife, fye tu ka ende omafiku atatu kombuwa tu ka yandjele Omwene Kalunga ketu omayambo.’ "
But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless [he is forced] by a strong hand. ,"Ndelenee Ame ondi shi shii nokutya, ohamba yaEgipiti itai mu lekele nande tai fininikwa keke li neenghono. "
So I will reach out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders which I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will let you go. ,"Ndele Ame ohandi ka nanena kombada yaEgipiti eke lange nohandi ke va monifila oikumwifa nomadidiliko aa handi ka ningila ko, opo nee ye ote mu lekele mu dje mo."
"And I will grant this people favor and respect in the sight of the Egyptians; therefore, it shall be that when you go, you will not go empty-handed.","“Ndele oshiwana eshi Ame ohandi ke shi filifa onghenda kOvaegipiti, opo ngeenge tamu ka dja mo, itamu ka dja mo hamakasha,"
"But every woman shall [insistently] ask her neighbor and any woman who lives in her house, for articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons and daughters. In this way you are to plunder the Egyptians",ndelenee keshe omwalikadi e nokweehela omushiinda shaye naava ve li meumbo laye oinima oisiliveli noingoldo noikutu. Ndele nye otamu i humbatifa ovana veni ovamati noukadona; nosho ngaha tamu ka kufa oihakanwa kOvaegipiti.”
"Then Moses answered [the Lord] and said, “What if they will not believe me or take seriously what I say? For they may say, ‘The Lord has not appeared to you.’ ” ","Opo nee Moses okwa nyamukula ta ti: “Ndelenee vo ngeenge itava itavele nge ndele itava pwilikine ondaka yange, ndelenee tava ti: ‘Omwene ine ku lihololela?’ ” "
"And the Lord said to him, “What is that in your hand?” And he said, “A staff.” ",Opo nee Omwene ta pula Moses ta ti: “Oshike shi li meke loye?” Ndele ye okwa nyamukula: “Onhaili.” 
"Then He said, “Throw it on the ground.” So Moses threw it on the ground, and it became a [living] serpent [like the royal symbol on the crown of Pharaoh]; and Moses ran from it. ","Ndele Ye ta ti: “I ekela poshi.” Opo ye e i ekela poshi, ndele yo oya ninga eyoka, naMoses okwe li ya onhapo."
"But the Lord said to Moses, “Reach out your hand and grasp it by the tail.” So he reached out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand","Opo nee Omwene okwa lombwela Moses: “Nana eke loye u li kwate komushila.” Moses okwa nana eke laye nokwe li kwata, ndele lo ola ninga onhaili meke laye, "
"You shall do this,” said the Lord,] “so that the elders may believe that the Lord, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has [most certainly] appeared to you.”","Opo venya ve na okwiitavela nokutya: “Omwene Kalunga kaAbraham, Kalunga kaIsak naKalunga kaJakob e ku lihololela.”"
"The Lord also said to him, “Put your hand into your robe [where it covers your chest].” So he put his hand into his robe, and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, as white as snow. ","NOmwene okwe mu lombwela vali: “Shitika eke loye monghwapa.” Ndele ye okwa shitika eke laye monghwapa yaye. Ndele ye eshi e li kufa mo, la kwatwa koshilundu, la toka ngaashi eemhawe."
"Then God said, “Put your hand into your robe again.” So he put his hand back into his robe, and when he took it out, it was restored [and was] like the rest of his body.","Ndele Ye ta ti: “Shitika mo vali eke loye monghwapa yoye.” Ndele okwa shitika eke laye monghwapa yaye; ndele eshi e li kufa mo, lo la li la yela ngaashi olutu laye. "
"“If they will not believe you or pay attention to the evidence of the first sign, they may believe the evidence of the second sign. ","Ndele Kalunga okwa ti vali: “Ngeenge itave ku itavele noitava udu molwedidiliko lotete, opo nee tava itavele molwedidiliko laxuuninwa."
"But if they will not believe these two signs or pay attention to what you say, you are to take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water which you take out of the river will turn into blood on the dry ground.”","Ndele ngeenge itava itavele omadidiliko aa avali noitava pwilikine ondaka yoye, teka hano omeva muNil u a tile poukukutu. Opo nee omeva aa a kufwa muNil taa ka ninga ohonde poukukutu.”"
"Then Moses said to the Lord, “Please, Lord, I am not a man of words (eloquent, fluent), neither before nor since You have spoken to Your servant; for I am slow of speech and tongue.” ","Opo nee Moses okwa lombwela Omwene: “Akutu Omwene, ame nghi shii kupopya; onghela nongheleinya nonena eli, eshi wa popifa omupiya woye; osheshi okutumbula kwange taku nyenge nge nelaka lange olidjuu.”"
"The Lord said to him, “Who has made man’s mouth? Or who makes the mute or the deaf, or the seeing or the blind? Is it not I, the Lord? ","NOmwene okwe mu nyamukula: “Olyelye a shitila omunhu okanya? Nolyelye a shita omufitandaka nomufitamatwi, omunamesho nomupofi? Haame Omwene?"
"Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth, and will teach you what you shall say.” ","Inda ko hano ashike naame ohandi ka kala nokanya koye noku ku longa, eshi u nokupopya.” "
"But he said, “Please my Lord, send the message [of rescue to Israel] by [someone else,] whomever else You will [choose].”","Ndelenee ye ta ti: “Akutu Omwene, tuma ko umwe, nande olyelye wa hala.” "
"Then the anger of the Lord was kindled and burned against Moses; He said, “Is there not your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know that he speaks fluently. Also, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be overjoyed. ","Opo nee ehandu lOmwene la xwamena Moses ndele Ye ta ti: “Omumwanyoko Aron, Omulevi, oko e li ndi shii. Ondi shi shii ye e shii okupopya nawa. Ndele ye ote ku shakeneke. Noye eshi te ku mono omutima waye tau ka hafa. "
"You must speak to him and put the words in his mouth; I, even I, will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you are to do. ","Ove u nokupopya nokutula mokanya kaye eendjovo. Ndele Ame ohandi ka kala nokanya koye nonokanya kaye, nde handi mu longo eshi mu nokuninga. "
"Moreover, he shall speak for you to the people; he will act as a mouthpiece for you, and you will be as God to him [telling him what I say to you].","Ndele ye e nokupopya novanhu ponhele yoye, noye ota ka ninga okanya koye naave to ningi kalunga kuye."
"You shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs [the miracles which prove I sent you].”","Kufa hano onhaili ei meke loye, nayo u nokuninga omadidiliko.”"
"Then Moses went away and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please, let me go back so that I may return to my relatives in Egypt, and see if they are still alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” ","Opo nee Moses okwa dja po nokwa shuna koxemweno Jetro, ndele ye ta ti kuye: “Efe nge ndi shune kovamwameme ava ve li muEgipiti, ndi mone ngeenge ve nomwenyo natango.” Ndele Jetro te mu lombwele: “Inda nombili.”"
"Then the Lord said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life [for killing the Egyptian] are dead.”","NOmwene ye okwa lombwela Moses muMidian ta ti: “Inda ko u shune kuEgipiti. Osheshi ovanhu aveshe venya va li va hala oku ku dipaa, ova fya.”"
"So Moses took his wife [Zipporah] and his sons [Gershom and Eliezer] and seated them on donkeys, and returned to the land of Egypt. Moses also took the staff of God in his hand.","Moses okwa kufa omwalikadi waye novana vaye ovamati nokwe va londeka kondongi, ndele a shuna kedu laEgipiti. Onhaili yaKalunga Moses e i kwete meke laye. "
"The Lord said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders (miracles) which I have put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and make him stubborn so that he will not let the people go. ","NOmwene okwa lombwela Moses ta ti: “Paife eshi to shuna kuEgipiti, tala, ka ninge oikumwifa aishe ei nde i ku pa, koshipala shaFarao. Ndelenee Ame ohandi ka kukutika omutima waye, opo ye ita ka efa oshiwana shi dje mo."
"Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the Lord, “Israel is My son, My firstborn. ",Ove u nokulombwela Farao kutya Omwene ta ti ngaha: ‘Israel oye oshiveli shange; 
"So I say to you, ‘Let My son go so that he may serve Me’; and if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.","onghee handi ku lombwele, lekela omona wange omumati, opo a shiive okulongela nge. Ndelenee ngeenge to anye oku mu lekela, tala, oiveli yoye Ame ohandi i dipaa."
"Now it happened at the lodging place, that the Lord met Moses and sought to kill him [making him deathly ill because he had not circumcised one of his sons","Hano mondjila, fimbo ve li monhanda, Omwene okwe mu hanga nokwa hala oku mu dipaa. "
"Then Zipporah took a flint knife and cut off the foreskin of her son and threw it at Moses’ feet, and said, “Indeed you are a husband of blood to me!” ","Opo nee Sippora okwa kufa okamanya ka upikwa nokwa kengha oshipa shonhele youlumenhu womona waye omumati nokwe shi kumifa eemhadi daMoses ndele ta ti: “Oshili, oove omuhomboli wange wopahonde.” "
"So He let Moses alone [to recover]. At that time Zipporah said, “You are a husband of blood”—because of the circumcision.",Ndele Ye okwe mu efa. Opo ye okwa tile: “Omuhomboli wopahonde! Omolwokupita etanda.”
"The Lord said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went and met him at the mountain of God (Sinai) and kissed him.","Omwene okwa lombwela yo Aron ta ti: “Inda u ka shakeneke Moses mofuka.” Ndele ye okwa ya nokwe mu shakeneka komhunda yaKalunga, ndele okwe mu fipa komilungu. "
"Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord with which He had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him to do.",Opo nee Moses okwa hepaululila Aron eendjovo adishe dOmwene nado Ye okwe mu tuma nomadidiliko aeshe oo Ye e mu lombwela. 
Then Moses and Aaron went [into Egypt] and assembled all the elders of the Israelites; ,Ndele Moses naAron ova ya nova ongaleka ovakulunhu aveshe vOvaisraeli.
and Aaron said all the words which the Lord had spoken to Moses. Then Moses performed the signs [given to him by God] before the people.,"NaAron okwa hepaulula eendjovo adishe odo Omwene e di lombwela Moses, nomadidiliko okwe a ninga moipafi yovanhu. "
"So the people believed; and when they heard that the Lord was concerned about the Israelites and that He had looked [with compassion] on their suffering, then they bowed their heads and worshiped ","Novanhu va itavela. Ndele vo eshi va uda nokutya, Omwene okwa dimbulukwa Ovaisraeli nokwa mona oudjuu wavo, vo ove linyongamena nokutwa oipala yavo poshi."
"Afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, ‘Let My people go, so that they may celebrate a feast to Me in the wilderness.","Ndele Moses naAron ova ya kuFarao ndele tava ti kuye: “Omwene Kalunga kaIsrael ta ti ngaha: ‘Lekela oshiwana shange, shi ka ningile nge oshivilo mombuwa."
"But Pharaoh said, “Who is the Lord that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the Lord, nor will I let Israel go.” ","Ndelenee Farao ta nyamukula: “Omwene olyelye, ame ndi pwilikine ondaka yaye ndi lekele Israel? Omwene ou kandi mu shii noitandi ka lekela Israel a dje mo.” "
"Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go on a three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God, so that He does not discipline us with pestilence or with the sword.”","Vo otava ti: “Kalunga kOvaheberi okwe tu shakeneka. Tu lekela hano, tu ka ye mondjila yomafiku atatu, tu ka yambele Omwene Kalunga ketu mombuwa, opo ehe tu dipaife oudu wolutapo ile eongamukonda.” "
"But the king of Egypt said to Moses and Aaron, “Why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens!” ","Ndelenee ohamba yaEgipiti ye va nyamukula, tai ti: “Moses naAron, omolwashike tamu kelele ovanhu va longe oilonga yavo? Indeni mu ka longe! "
"Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now many, and you would have them stop their work!” ","Farao okwa tile vali: Taleni, ovanhu vomoshilongo ovahapu nokuli, ndele mwa hala va fe oilonga yavo?"
"The very same day Pharaoh gave orders to the [Egyptian] taskmasters in charge of the people and their [Hebrew] foremen, saying,","Mefiku tuu olo Farao okwa lombwela ovafininiki vomovanhu novapashukili voilonga, ndele ta ti: "
You will no longer give the people straw to make brick as before; let them go and gather straw for themselves.,Ovanhu inamu va pa vali omwiidi mokufoloma eedopi ngaashi shito. Ovo vene nave ke liongelele omwiidi. 
"But the number of bricks which they were making before, you shall [still] require of them; you are not to reduce it in the least. For they are idle and lazy; that is why they cry, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ ",Ndelenee eedopi di fike pwaadinya donghela nodongheleinya mu noku di pula kuvo. Inamu ninipalifa omuvalu wado. Osheshi vo ovandede. Onghee hava ingida tava ti: ‘Tu ka ningile Kalunga ketu exwikilo!’ 
"Let labor be heavier on the men, and let them work [hard] at it so that they will pay no attention to [their God’s] lying words.”","Oshilonga nashi ninge shidjuu shili kovalumenhu, opo va kale mokulonga, vaha pwilikine eendjovo doipupulu.” "
"Then the [Egyptian] taskmasters [in charge] of the people and their [Hebrew] foremen went out and said to the people, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I will not give you any straw. ",Opo nee ovafininiki vovanhu novapashukili va pita mo ndele va lombwela ovanhu ndele tava ti: “Farao osho ta ti: ‘Itandi mu pe omwiidi nande. 
"Go, get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work [quota] will not be reduced in the least.’ ”",Indeni nye vene mu ka tale ko omwiidi keshe apa tau monika. Ndele oilonga yeni itai shuna monima.’ 
So the people were scattered throughout the land of Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw. ,Opo nee ovanhu va endaenda moshilongo ashishe shaEgipiti va ka ongele oimbodi ponhele yomwiidi.
"And the taskmasters pressured them, saying, “Finish your work, [fulfill] your daily quotas, just as when there was straw [given to you].” ",Novafininiki va fininika ndele tava ti: “Wanifeni oshilonga sheni keshe efiku naanaa ngaashi mefimbo linya pa li omwiidi.”
"And the Hebrew foremen, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, “Why have you not fulfilled your required quota of making bricks yesterday and today, as before?”","Hano ovalongifi venya Ovaisraeli va dengwa kovafininiki ava va tulwa po kuFarao, ndele tava ti: “Oshike hano inamu wanifa oilonga yeni onghela nonena, ngaashi shito, mu wanife omuvalu weedopi ngaashi mwa lombwelwa?”"
"Then the Hebrew foremen came to Pharaoh and cried, “Why do you deal like this with your servants? ",Onghee hano ovapashukili Ovaisraeli va ya nova kemena Farao ndele va pulwa: “Omolwashike ove ho ningile ngaha novapiya voye?
"No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ And look, your servants are being beaten, but it is the fault of your own people.”","Osheshi ovapiya voye itava pewa omwiidi, naavenya tava ti kufye: ‘Folomeni eedopi!’ Ndele tala, ovapiya voye tava dengwa, ndelenee oushima u li movanhu voye.”"
"But Pharaoh said, “You are lazy, very lazy and idle! That is why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.’","Ndelenee ye okwa nyamukula ta ti: “Onye ovandede, heeno, ovandede. Onghee tamu ti: ‘Tu lekela tu ka ningile Omwene exwikilo.’ "
"Get out now and get to work; for no straw will be given to you, yet you are to deliver the same quota of bricks.” ",Hano paife eshi indeni ashike mu ka longe. Ndelenee itamu pewa omwiidi. Ndelenee wanifeni omuvalu weedopi naanaa.”
"The Hebrew foremen saw that they were in a bad situation because they were told, “You must not reduce [in the least] your daily quota of bricks.” ","Opo nee ovapashukili Ovaisraeli ove liwete vo nhumbi ve li moudjuu, eshi pa lombwelwa: “Nye mu nokuwanifa eedopi deni keshe efiku omuvalu wado; omuvalu itau shunifwa monima.” "
"When they left Pharaoh’s presence, the foremen met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them. ","Ndele ve uya kuMoses naAron ava va li ko ofika ve va shakeneke venya eshi va dja kuFarao,"
"And the foremen said to them, “May the Lord look upon you and judge you, because you have made us odious (something hated) in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and you have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”","ndele vo ove va lombwela: “Omwene ne mu kwatele onghone noku mu tokola, eshi nye mwe tu tondifa momesho aFarao nomomesho ovapiya vaye, osheshi mwa yandja meke lavo eongamukonda vo ve tu dipae.”"
"hen Moses turned again to the Lord and said, “O Lord, why have You brought harm and oppression to this people? Why did You ever send me? [I cannot understand Your purpose!] ","Opo nee Moses okwa ya vali kOmwene ndele ta ti: “Omwene, omolwashike wa ningila oshiwana eshi owii? Omolwashike Ove wa tuma nge oku?"
"Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has harmed and oppressed this people, and You have done nothing at all to rescue Your people.”","Osheshi okefimbo tuu linya nda ya kuFarao ndi popye medina loye, ye okwa hepeka oshiwana eshi, naave ino xupifa oshiwana shoye.”"

In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,Eshito lounyuni Pehovelo Kalunga okwa shita eulu nedu.
"Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters","Ndele edu ola li la tokekwa nola li hamungaho, nomulaulu owa li kombada youle womeva, nOmhepo yaKalunga ya tengelela kombada yomeva."
"And God said, ""Let there be light,"" and there was light",Ndele Kalunga okwa ti: “Nape uye ouyelele!” Nouyelele owe uya.
"God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness",Ndele Kalunga okwa tala ouyelele oo omuwa.
"And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day","Ndele opa ningwa onguloshi nongula, efiku lotete."
So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it,Ndele Kalunga okwa ninga evalelwa nokwa tongola omeva aa a kala koshi yevalelwa naa a kala kombada yevalelwa.
And it was so,Ndele osho sha ningwa.
"And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day","Ndele opa ningwa onguloshi nongula, efiku etivali."
And it was so,Ndele osho sha ningwa.
And God saw that it was good,"Opo nee Kalunga e shi tala, sha wapala."
And it was so,Ndele osho sha ningwa.
The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds,"Edu ola twimika omwiidi, noimeno ya eta eembuto pamaludi ayo nomiti da ima oiimati mu na ombuto yado pamaludi ado."
And God saw that it was good,"Opo Kalunga okwe shi tala, sha wapala."
"And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day","Ndele pa ningwa onguloshi nongula, efiku etitatu."
And it was so,Ndele osho sha ningwa.
God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night,"Ndele Kalunga okwa ninga ouyelele vivali va kalunga, ouyelele omunene wi kaleke mOtenya nale omundjungu wi kaleke mOufiku."
He also made the stars,Ndele okwa ninga oinima.
"To govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness","Wookaleke omutenya, neoufiku, noku ninge etongoko pokati kouyelele nomulaulu."
And God saw that it was good,"Opo Kalunga okwe shi tala, sha wapala."
"And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day","Ndele pa ningwa onguloshi nongula, efiku eline."
"So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind","Ndele Kalunga okwa ninga oonyanyu va monene, nenyanyu dhedi dha mu na ounyuni uume omeva nomashike alo ya monene, pa maludi gado, neeni oonyuni dha monene pamaludi gado."
And God saw that it was good,"Opo Kalunga okwe shi tala, sha wapala."
"And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day","Ndele pa ningwa onguloshi nongula, efiku etaano."
And it was so,Ndele osho sha ningwa.
"God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds","Ndele Kalunga okwa ninga ooyalunde pamaludi gado, neenikosa nooyalunde, nooyalunde, nomuloka eedhu pamaludi gado."
And God saw that it was good,"Opo Kalunga okwe shi tala, sha wapala."
"So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them","Ndele Kalunga okwa ninga muntu, muulina weene, muulina waKalunga, owiima nalye mukwanekamba."
And it was so,Ndele osho sha ningwa.
"God saw all that he had made, and it was very good","Opo Kalunga a shi tala osha ningwa, sha wapala mwenee."
"And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day","Ndele pa ningwa onguloshi nongula, efiku elimwe."
Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array,"Ndele pa ningwa omalwela la eulu neEdu miine, neEdu ya ti waluka osha ningwa."
By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work,"Efiku elimwe Kalunga osha ningwa omayego ga okwi ninga, pa nale kOnzimbinga ndele efiku lyaValwe kwa ningwa."
"Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done","Ndele Kalunga okwa ninga efiku elimwe kwa pilukile nale ku shita eLongelo, ndelenga kwa longo okwa ningwa po efiku elimwe kwa pilukile."
"This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens","Osho mboka epokondje la eulu neEdu, nale kwa ninga."
But streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground,"Ndele meva ya kala meula, yoEdu ya pilukile kEdu."
"Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being","Ndele Kalunga owa ninga omuntu omuthu wElondo, nasho a vule mEpulo, sho omuntu a valukwa, sho a nga omhupitha."
"Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed","Kalunga owa yandja omuti, muEden, ndelenga kalunga nda peikwa."
The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground—trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,"Kalunga owa ninga omiti yoomiti dhidhidha, naoyimeno oya kala ya hohokelela mewoko, neenkundu, neeshike shi thominika kombada nelondo ndhuu, noomiti yooya nomuloki momiti dhidhidha, neembuto yadhidha."
A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters,Noondjina dha kala yiwa mekwetepo.
"The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold","Noondjina dhi li muEdu ohandjina lya li muOndjinda lyOpili, lyokwe muEden."
The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush,"Ohandjina lyokwe lya li muOmbele, noondjina nawa kwenda kwatye."
The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates,Ohandjina lyekewa lyombele ohandjina lyombele ohandjina lyekewa.
The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it,Kalunga owa peikwa omulandu muEdu nale eikokama.
"Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name","Kalunga owa kaleke oombuto, noonyuni va li kEdu, nale ya tekela mulandu opo shi a toloke."
"So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals","Omuinwa owa tongolola, noombuto, neenyuni, neenikosa yoompito."
But for Adam no suitable helper was found,Omundu kwa kaleke omundandi.
"So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and then closed up the place with flesh","Kalunga owa eko omulandu omuti mombanda, sho a ti: woshi owuuna shikoko."
"Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man","Kalunga owa ninga mulandu, ne kwa yamukula."
"That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh","MoEdu kwa ningwa omukazona, noomoka, eeshike lyAadam okwe ya tolonge."
"Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame",Adam neEtsha va ninga.
"""You will not certainly die,"" the serpent said to the woman",Ndele ombanda owa ti: “Owi.”
